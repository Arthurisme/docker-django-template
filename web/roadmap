12:     change chore.complete field True to False:
   1-change it in models.py
   2-change it in database, or in shell, or run makemigrattions,migrate again
     in the way of shell:
     jython manage.py shell
     >>> from  chores.models import ChoreList, Chore
     >>> ChoreList.objects.all()
     []
     >>> from django.utils import timezone
     >>> list= ChoreList(name="Monday list", due_date=timezone.now())
     >>> list.name
     'Monday list'
     >>> list.due_date
     datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 17, 19, 17, 40, 722000, tzinfo=<UTC>)
     >>> list.save()
13: let data field have a return string for view in shell, quit and restart jython shell.
    {python shell is very important.}

14: add superuser:jython manage.py createsuperuser   Admin greybox
15: import the models into admin: admin.site.register(ChoreList)
16: In home imac, the postgresql is on python3, not python2.
    jython on home imac is error: unicode or tzinfo, or database.
    And fail in jython database driver for: postgresql, mysql.
17: now, only python and python3 work well for this project.(I will try jython-django on unbuntu after master the grail
    and spring,jhiperster)
18; add some fileds in admin.py.
    Regroup the admin field: (None,{'fields':['name']}),
19: class collapse  'classes':['collapse']
20: Add another model in admin
21: Put the new add model in its parent in admin   --- StackedInline , inlines
22: StackedInline to tabulaInline (So beautiful a little move).
23: Build a only-a-line-text page and build a url.py in chores:
    url(r'^$',  views.index, name='index')
    link this page. And then link url.py in Chorelist to
    url.py in chores:
    url(r'^chores/', include('chores.urls')),
